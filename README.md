What is Data Analytics?

Data analytics, also known as data analysis, is the process of cleaning, inspecting, modelling, and transforming data for finding valuable information, informing conclusions and enhancing the decision-making process. 
Data analytics focuses on using data to generate insights while machine learning focuses on creating and training algorithms through data so they can function independently. 

Steps involved in Data Analysis:

1.  DATA WRANGLING : Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, or Data Pre-Processing, is the process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning of “raw” data into a form suitable for analysis

       Data Wrangling has 3 sub-steps
       
       1. Gathering of data
        
       2. Assessing of data
        
       3. Data Cleaning

2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) : Once the data is collected, cleaned, and processed, it is ready for Analysis. As you manipulate data, you may find you have the exact information you need, or you might need to collect more data. During this phase, you can use data analysis tools and software which will help you to understand, interpret, and derive conclusions based on the requirements.
